# Multi-AI Pro MCP Demo

## Quick Demo Commands

After installation, try these commands in Claude Desktop or Claude Code:

### 1. Ask a Single AI Model
```
Ask DeepSeek R1: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
```

### 2. Compare Multiple Models
```
Compare responses from GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini on: "What's the best programming language for beginners?"
```

### 3. Orchestrate Multiple AIs
```
Use parallel orchestration to design a REST API for a todo application
```

### 4. Sequential Refinement
```
Use sequential strategy to write a comprehensive guide on machine learning
```

### 5. AI Debate
```
Have GPT-4 and Claude debate: "Should AI development be regulated?"
```

### 6. Search Conversation History
```
Search our previous conversations for "API design"
```

### 7. Get Usage Statistics
```
Show me a summary of my AI usage and token consumption
```

## Example Orchestration Strategies

### Parallel Strategy
- All models work simultaneously
- Best response is selected automatically
- Great for getting diverse perspectives quickly

### Sequential Strategy  
- Each model refines the previous response
- Builds upon previous work iteratively
- Perfect for complex, multi-step problems

### Debate Strategy
- Models discuss and argue different viewpoints
- Multiple rounds of back-and-forth
- Excellent for exploring controversial topics

### Consensus Strategy
- Models work together to reach agreement
- Collaborative problem-solving approach
- Ideal for decision-making processes

### Specialist Strategy
- Routes questions to the most appropriate model
- Uses each AI's strengths optimally
- Best for domain-specific queries

## Advanced Features

### Context Management
- All conversations are remembered across sessions
- Search through your entire conversation history
- Context is preserved between different orchestration strategies

### Model Selection
- Automatic selection of best models for each task
- Over 100 models available via OpenRouter
- Includes latest models: DeepSeek R1, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet

### Performance Analytics
- Track token usage across all models
- Monitor response quality and speed
- Optimize costs with usage insights

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed prompts get better results
2. **Use Orchestration**: Multiple models often produce better solutions
3. **Leverage Context**: Reference previous conversations for continuity
4. **Try Different Strategies**: Each orchestration method has different strengths
5. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of token consumption to optimize costs
